# Global-Currency

## Description
Have you ever went travelling and thought about what type of currency that country uses, or confused how much of your money is equal to another?
Fear not for I have created Global Currency, a program that does those two exact things for you.

This is a program that is able to convert certain currencies into others. It is also able to tell you what type of 
currency a country is using so that you are prepared when you travel there. If that type of currency is in our current database,
it will also give you an option to exchange your money with the one given.

## Improvements
Right now, I have tons of JSON files with the associated exchange rates and as we know, exchange rates fluctuate from day to day.
So, this is not the most accurate. The most effective way of running this program is by using an API; however, all the exchange rate
APIs require payment. Once one becomes available to me, I will use APIs instead of various JSON files.

I can also make this code more compact and organized by implementing OOP (object orientated programming), which means putting classes
and methods into my program. I can also do this by finding more efficient ways to run my code, for example, finding lines of code that could be ran with just
one.
